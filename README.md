# Coding Challenges

This is a fun and interactive coding challenge from
[codingchallenges.fyi](https://codingchallenges.fyi/), which is most likely
created and run by [John Crickett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johncrickett/)
(Though I am not sure if it has other creators). The idea behind these
challenges are to learn some new programming language and technology by building
something from real world.

You can find all the coding challenges
[here](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro).
